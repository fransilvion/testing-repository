```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Mpg plot

At first we should load tidyverse library:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

After this we should run this chunk of code in order to build desirable plot:
```{r cars}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv, size = class)) +
  geom_point()
```
